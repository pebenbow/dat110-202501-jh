# Instructions

Welcome to CSC 110 Lab Zero! This is a sample lab assignment to help you 
understand how lab assignments should be completed, rendered, and submitted to 
Gradescope.

This is a **pair programming** assignment: one student acts as the **driver**, the other as the 
**navigator**. The driver writes code while the navigator directs them on what to write based on the 
assignment instructions, and provides feedback and help as needed. You should rotate these roles 
roughly every 15 minutes so each person gets plenty of time in the "driver's seat."

Lab assignments can be taken **open-book** using the R4DS textbook and **open-note** 
using the notes you've taken and the materials we have covered in class. 
You should not rely on any other outside resources. Usage of generative AI 
tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or DeepSeek is not allowed on this assignment.

-   Write R code in each code chunk to load, transform, and plot your data.
-   To earn full credit on coding questions, your code and its output must both be visible.
-   If a coding question produces a plot/figure:
    -   Include clear and descriptive labels (title, axis, etc.)
    -   Include the `label` and `fig-cap` options at the top of each code block
-   Written (non-code) answers to questions should be typed out in the answer boxes that are provided for you. Do not replace the heading in each answer box, but instead type your responses below each heading.
-   I recommend you save and render your Quarto doc as an HTML document regularly. This not only has the benefit of showing your output, but it also tests your code to make sure everything is working. Any errors that the rendering engine encounters will be displayed in the RStudio console.
-   **Remember:** all work is done under the Honor Code, and you must pledge your work at the end of the assignment.
-   When finished, render your Quarto doc as a PDF, review it carefully for completeness and cleanliness, and submit it in Gradescope. Your Qmd file will stay stored in JupyterHub if we need to refer back to it.

# Setup

First, run the code block below to load the necessary packages.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

Next, create a new data frame named "df" containing the mtcars dataset that is 
included in the Tidyverse, then use `glimpse()` to preview the data.

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| message: false

df <- mtcars

glimpse(df)
```

## Exercise 1

### Exercise 1.1

Make a scatterplot with `disp` on the X axis and `mpg` on the Y axis, and size 
your points by the `wt` variable.

```{r}
#| label: fig1.1
#| fig-cap: "Plot 1.1"
#| warning: false

ggplot(
  data = df,
  mapping = aes(
    x    = disp,
    y    = mpg,
    size = wt
  )
) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") + 
  labs(
    title = "Engine displacement versus vehicle mileage and weight",
    x     = "Engine displacement",
    y     = "Miles per gallon",
    size  = "Weight (tons)"
  )
```

### Exercise 1.2

Do you see a correlation of some kind in the chart? What might we conclude about 
the relationship between engine displacement and vehicle mileage based on our 
plot?

# Submission checklist

Before submitting your assignment in Gradescope, review this checklist carefully 
to ensure you have done everything appropriately.

-   Correct authors and date
-   All code is clearly visible
-   All output is clearly visible (does not apply to the Setup section), including labels and legends
-   Written responses are typed into the appropriate answer boxes
-   All empty or redundant plots are removed
-   Honor Code pledge is signed

Point penalties will be assessed if your assignment does not meet these guidelines.

# Grading

### Data viz questions

-   1 point = Code and output are both clearly and completely visible
-   1 point = Correct geom is used
-   1 point = Correct aesthetics are applied
-   1 point = Descriptive labels are applied

### Short answer questions

-   1 point = Answers the question thoughtfully
-   1 point = Provides clear expository writing
